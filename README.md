# dflow-relax
## Relaxation with VASP, ABACUS, and LAMMPS in autotest.
This workflow is a part of [AI Square](https://aissquare.com/). We want to refract the autotest code based on dflow. 
This is "general properties test" (elastic parameters, EOS, surface energy, interstitial energy, vacancy energy and stacking fault energy supported so far) using VASP, LAMMPS, or ABACUS.

## Easy Install：
```
pip install "git+https://github.com/ZLI-afk/dflow-props.git"
```

## Quick Start
You can go to the `example` folder and there are some examples for reference. You can go to one of them and fill in the `global.json` file. Then you can submit the workflow.

If you want to use VASP code to do the DFT relaxation, like the folder `vasp_demo`. You need to run dflow-relax to obtain relaxed structures firstly, then ：
``` 
dflowprops --vasp
```

If you want to use ABACUS code, like the folder `abacus_demo`. You need to prepare `INPUT`, `STRU`, `*.UPF`, `global.json` and `param_prop.json` (notice that `*.orb` and `KPT` are optional ), then：
```
dflowprops --abacus
```

If you want to use LAMMPS to do MD calculation, like the folder `dp_demo`. You need to prepare `POSCAR`, `frozen_model.pb`, `global.json` and `param_prop.json`, then:
```
dflowprops --lammps
```

You can monitor the workflow process on the [website](https://workflows.deepmodeling.com).
